## Project Summary
This project was completed as part of the CareerFoundry Data Analytics Program and focuses on analyzing sales data from Instacart, a leading online grocery delivery platform. The goal was to uncover customer purchasing patterns and provide actionable insights to inform targeted marketing campaigns and customer segmentation strategies. Using Python and various data visualization techniques, the analysis highlights critical trends in customer behavior and product performance.

## Objectives
- Identify the busiest days of the week and times of the day for Instacart orders.
- Analyze spending patterns during different times to guide product-specific advertising.
- Segment Instacart products into price ranges and identify popular product categories.
- Investigate customer demographics and purchasing behaviors, including:
- Brand loyalty patterns and their impact on sales.
- Regional differences in ordering habits.
- Relationships between age, family status, and purchasing behavior.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python programming for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- Merging and preprocessing Instacart datasets to create a unified analysis framework.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover actionable insights.
- Presenting results through data visualizations tailored for stakeholder communication.
